# AP_Phys1_23_spring

* Sunday 12:30-1:55pm  3/5, 3/12, 3/19, 4/2, 4/9, 4/16, 4/23, 4/30

* Space and Time
    * Space - 3D - s, l - meter (m) or km
         * Pythagoras theorem -- its length is invariable 
         * the interaction of 3 dim gives you trigonometry -- How do you project
    * time  - t - sec (s)
    * Space and time interact -> velocity (vector) -> acceleration
* mass - kg
* Calculus
    * how to describe changes
    * velocity -- distance is changing -- divide the change by time -- \Delta s / \Delta t -- first derivative -- position/time curve -- slope
    * acceleration -- the velocity is changing -- ...... --- 2nd derivative -- position/time curve -- 
    
* Physics - Newtons 2nd law
    * F = ma --> introduces new concept F -- Force are not independent, it is the result of something - stuff accelerate 
    * first law a = 0
    * 3rd law - what is F - F is a interaction, F is between two objects, A feel F, then necessarily B feels -F
    
    * kind of force -- gravity (g), normal force (perp to the surface), friction (tangential), asserted force (push/pull), spring (kx)
    
* Energy
    * A principle, things don't change on its own, so there is a quantity being conserved and --
    * Every interaction transfers something 
    * No F, v is constant -- E associated with v
    * With F, v changed, -- E changed with v --> E = 1/2 mv2 --> triangle 
    * When velocity seems disapper, potential engergy -- exchange velocity with spacial position (gh)
                                                      -- spring new potential 
                                                      -- chemical, nuclear engery, 
    * We start with energy conservation, then give whatever missing part a new name
* Momentum
    * Conservation within kinetic energy -- mv -- vector
    * Again, not new physics, but a different way of combining newtons 2nd and 3rd law
        * F = m1 a1, F = m2 a2 , total change across the interaction, add up all the change across time -- integration -- ma -> mv -> conserved 
        * Conservatin of momentum is the 3rd law
* Gravitation -- the only first physics -- this one depends on what universe you live in         
    * We still not exactly sure what is gravitation yet 
    * Memorize the formula, and may be the K laws -- there are finite problems 
* Rotation -- kinetic and dynamic -- a consequence of all the previous 1D problem + trigonomety --> give you the shortcut formula 

* Oscillation -- special case energe conservation -> we can describe the whole motion
