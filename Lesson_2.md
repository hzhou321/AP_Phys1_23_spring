# Lesson 2 - 3/12/2023

* Statics -- force analyses
    * rod - hanging
* Circuit 
* If your school is not doing AP PHYS 1 test practice, try do 1 practice each week

Guideline
* 90 min/ 50 multiple choice. Your goal < 1 min per multiple choice, anything over or uncertain, make a mark
* 90 min/ 5 free response, shooting for 10 min each problem, roughly 2 min per sub-question
* Don't need be precise on timing, but it is critical to have it (time it).

* Static balancing problem
    * 2D space -> 2 orthogonal direction, commonly vertical and horizontal
    * The elements of balancing
        * static force  -- every object is subject static force equilibrium -- \Sum_fx = 0 \Sum_fy = 0
        * static torque -- if the object has shape, and if it has multiple force points 

1. step 1, identify the object to be balanced
2. step 2, identify force + torque
3. step 3, identify constraints -- the constraint point will have force to balance --> backing out the force from necessity 

* F in y direction
    1. pole weight down, 30N
    2. sign weight down, 80N
    3. Cable pulling up, X * sin(theta) = 0.5X
    4. Anchor pull, whatever balance the whole thing
* Static force is automatically balanced out

* Torque
   * Identify anchor -- 1 point that is not moving -- there is no special axis, every axis work the same for static -- math always checkout 
   * When there are multiple choices seems all gonna work, choose an arbitrary *convenient* one
* Torque at the anchor point
    * 30N * 1.1 + 80 * 1.3 = 0.5X * 2.2  --> X = 124.4
