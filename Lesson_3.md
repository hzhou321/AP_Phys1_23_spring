* T = 2pi sqrt(m/k)
* -> k = m / (T/2pi)^2
*  T= 38/8 = 4.75
*  T/2pi = 0.756
*  m/k = 0.572
*  k = 65 / 0.572 = 114 N/m

* kx = mg
*  x = mg / k = m/k * g = 0.572 * 9.8 = 5.6

* l = 25 - 5.6 = 19.4 m

## How spring works in oscilating
* the stiffer, the higher pitch -> smaller T
* freq ~ k, T is inverse of freq, inverse proportional to k
* freq inverse proportional to mass, T is proportional mass
* --> T ~ 2pi sqrt(m/k)
*      m = kg, k = N/m, N = kgm/s^2, m/k ~ s^2  

## work and energy
* object rest in space 
* Let's do some work to give it kinetic energy 
* F = ma
* After a second, the speed is at, the kinetic energy is 1/2 m v^2 = 1/2 m a^2 t^2
* Energe is like a state 
* Work is describing the change of state -> F = ma, W = F * 1/2 a t^2 = F x
* Think in a constant force, constant a, imagin a V-t graph

* Work / time  is proportional to velocity, W = F V t = Fx, W = \Delta E = F V \Delta t = F \Delta x

### W = F\Delta x = \Delta 1/2mv^2  - the same as Newton's 2nd law
* The time was hidden
* The leftside is the transaction view
* The rightside is the state view 

* Sometime the trasaction is explicit
* Sometime the states are clear

* In the free-fall case, constant g, constant force, mg, mgh -> potential energy --> A energy purely based position
* Height -- E_h = mgh
* Spring -- E_k = 1/2 kx^2
* Total energy  = Poential Energy(h, x) + Kinetic energy (v) + Chemical Potential Energy (atomic distance)

* K
* F = kx , k = F / x, N / x = kg m/s^2 / m = kg/s^2
* *Make sure each step perform one operation only*

* P = W/t = Fx/t = F 1/2at^2 /t = F 1/2 at = F 1/2 F/m * t = 1/2F^2t/m
* x = v0 t + 1/2 att

* P_h = P_v
* mgh = 1/2 m v^2
* gh = 1/2 v^2
* v = sqrt(2gh)
* h = l (1 - cos(theta))
